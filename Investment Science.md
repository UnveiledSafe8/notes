## Key Terms & Concepts

### Cash Flow
A sequence of money values over time, represented as:  
$$ (x_0, x_1, \dots, x_n) $$

### Cash Flow Stream
A vector of cash flows indexed by time; describes inflows/outflows over multiple periods.

### Comparison Principle
If one cash flow stream yields strictly more in every period than another, it is preferred.

### No-Arbitrage Principle
No way to make a profit without risk or investment. Equivalent cash flows must have the same price.

### Dynamic Markets
Markets where cash flows and valuations evolve over time.

### Risk Aversion
Preference for more certain outcomes over uncertain ones with the same expected return.

### Hedging
Using strategies or instruments to reduce exposure to financial risk.

### Risk Assessment
Evaluating potential losses and their likelihood.

### Futures
Contracts to buy/sell an asset at a set price at a set time.

### Present Value (PV)
The current value of future payments discounted at a given rate.

### Future Value (FV)
The value of cash flows at a future date using compound interest.

### Discounting
Determining the present value of future cash flows.

### Discount Factor
The factor used to convert future value to present:  
$$ \frac{1}{(1 + r)^t} $$

### Equivalent Streams
Two cash flow streams with the same present value:  
$$ \text{PV}(A) = \text{PV}(B) $$

### Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
The interest rate that sets the net present value of a cash flow stream to zero.

### Net Present Value (NPV)
Difference between present value of benefits and costs:  
$$ \text{NPV} = \text{PV}_{\text{Benefits}} - \text{PV}_{\text{Costs}} $$

### Present Value Method
Choose the project with the highest NPV.

### Internal Rate of Return Method
Choose the project with the highest IRR, assuming IRR is unique and exceeds the cost of capital.

### Risk-Free Rates
Return from virtually default-free investments (e.g., 3-month T-bills, bank certificates, cost of capital).

### Cost of Capital
Rate of return that a company must offer to potential investors.

### Nominal Interest Rate
Stated annual interest rate, without compounding.

### Effective Interest Rate
True annual return after compounding:  
$$ \left(1 + \frac{r}{m}\right)^m - 1 $$
### Inflation Rate
The percentage increase in the general price level of goods and services over a period of time. Commonly measured by indices like the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

### Real Dollars (Constant Dollars)
Dollar values that have been adjusted for inflation, reflecting purchasing power in terms of a base year. Used for accurate comparisons across different time periods.

### Actual Dollars (Nominal Dollars)
Dollar values not adjusted for inflation; reflect the value at the time of the transaction. Used in everyday pricing and accounting. May distort comparisons across time unless inflation is considered.

### Real Interest Rate
The interest rate that has been adjusted for inflation. Reflects the true increase in purchasing power for the lender or investor.

| Medium         | A     | A   |
|                | Baa   | BBB |
| Speculative    | Ba    | BB  |
|                | B     | B   |

|                | C     | C   |
|                |       | D   |

### Investment Grade Bond

A bond with a relatively low risk of default, rated BBB or higher by S&P or Baa or higher by Moody's.

### Junk Bond

A high-yield, high-risk bond rated below investment grade.

### Yield To Maturity

The internal rate of return for a bond.

### Par Bond

A bond that is trading at its face value (i.e., market price = par value -> coupon rate = yield to maturity).

### Yield To Call
The return a bondholder receives if the bond is called (redeemed by the issuer) before its maturity date. Calculated similarly to Yield to Maturity (YTM), but uses the call date and call price instead of maturity date and face value.

### Bond Duration
A measure of a bond’s sensitivity to interest rate changes. Expressed in years, it represents the weighted average time to receive the bond’s cash flows. Higher duration indicates more price sensitivity to interest rate changes.

### Interest Duration

Reflects how long, in years, it takes to recover the bond's price through interest payments.

### Macaulay Duration

Weighted average time to cash flow receipt using yield to maturity

### Price-Yield Curve

A graphical representation showing the inverse relationship between a bond’s price and its yield. Price drops more slowly as yields rise and rises faster as yields fall. Useful for visualizing how bond prices react to market interest rate movements. Longer maturities lead to more drastic price change effects from yield changes pivoting along bond par.

### Immunization

Immunization is a fixed-income portfolio strategy that ensures a target return is achieved regardless of interest rate movements by matching the duration of assets and liabilities. When properly immunized, the effect of interest rate changes on the present value of assets is offset by opposing changes in reinvestment returns, thereby preserving the portfolio’s ability to meet future liabilities. Net duration and present value with obligations and fixed income assets is 0.

### Reinvestment Risk

Reinvestment risk is the possibility that intermediate cash flows, such as coupon payments, will need to be reinvested at a lower interest rate than the original investment. This risk can reduce the total return of a bond below its yield to maturity, particularly when interest rates decline or the bond has high coupons and short duration.

### Reimmunization

Reimmunization is the process of adjusting a previously immunized portfolio to restore duration matching after interest rates, cash flows, or other market conditions have changed. It ensures continued protection against interest rate fluctuations and is necessary when the duration of assets and liabilities diverges over time due to market dynamics.

### Yield Curve

The yield curve is a graphical representation showing the relationship between interest rates (yields) and the time to maturity of debt instruments, typically government bonds, of equal credit quality. It reflects market expectations about future interest rates and economic activity.

### Normal vs Inverted Yield Curve

A normal yield curve slopes upward, indicating that longer-term bonds have higher yields than shorter-term ones, which suggests expectations of economic growth and potentially rising inflation. An inverted yield curve slopes downward, where short-term yields are higher than long-term yields, often interpreted as a signal of expected economic slowdown or recession.

### Term Structure Theory

Term structure theory seeks to explain the shape of the yield curve and includes several models. It takes the assumption that interest rates increase with time money must be held in a financial instrument.

### Spot Rate  
The yield on a zero-coupon bond maturing at a specific future date. It represents the market’s required return for a risk-free investment over a fixed period, starting today.

### Forward Rate  
The implied interest rate between two future periods, derived from current spot rates. It reflects market expectations for future interest rates.

### Spot Rate Curve  
A graph showing the relationship between spot rates and their respective maturities. It represents the term structure of interest rates and is fundamental for bond pricing and interest rate modeling. Follows similar structure to yield curve.

### Interest Rate Forecast  
A projection of future interest rates using market instruments (like forward rates), economic indicators, and monetary policy expectations.

### Short Rate  
The interest rate for an extremely short time period, typically referring to the annual forward rate at a given future time.

### Running Present Value  
The present value of the remaining cash flows from a bond or portfolio, using a recursive approach starting from the end.

### Floating Rate Bond  
A bond whose coupon payments adjust periodically based on a reference interest rate, plus a fixed spread. It reduces interest rate risk compared to fixed-rate bonds.

### Expectations Theory  
States that the shape of the yield curve is determined by market expectations of future short-term interest rates. A rising yield curve indicates anticipated rate increases.

### Expectations Hypothesis  
A specific form of the expectations theory assuming no risk premium, where forward rates equal expected future spot rates. It offers a theoretical framework but often diverges from empirical data.

### Liquidity Preference  
Suggests that investors prefer short-term bonds due to lower risk and higher liquidity. Consequently, long-term bonds must offer a premium (liquidity premium) to attract investors, often resulting in an upward-sloping yield curve.

### Market Segmentation  
Asserts that the bond market is segmented by maturity preferences of different investors. The yield curve shape is driven by supply and demand within each segment rather than rate expectations.

### Explanations For Spot Rate Curve Shape  
Expectations theory attributes the curve to anticipated future rates. Liquidity preference explains upward slopes through added premiums for longer maturities. Market segmentation emphasizes differing investor demands across maturity ranges.

### Invariance Theorem  
States that if interest rates evolve according to expectation dynamics, any amount invested will grow by the same amount regardless of the investment and reinvestment strategy.

## Equations

### Present and Future Value

Simple Interest:

Compound Interest:  
$$ V = P(1 + r)^t $$

Compounded \( m \) times per year:  
$$
V = P\left(1 + \frac{r}{m}\right)^{mt}
$$

Continuous Compounding:  
$$
\lim_{m \to \infty} \left(1 + \frac{r}{m} \right)^m = e^r
$$
$$
\left(1 + \frac{r}{m} \right)^{mt} \to e^{rt}
$$

### Future Value of a Cash Flow Stream
$$
FV = \sum_{k=0}^{n}x_k\left(1+r\right)^{n-k}
$$

### Present Value of a Cash Flow Stream

Discrete:  
$$
PV = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{x_k}{(1 + \frac{r}{m})^k}
$$

Continuous:  
$$
PV = \sum_{k=0}^{n} x_k \times e^{{-r}\times{k}}
$$

From FV:  
$$
PV = \frac{FV}{(1 + r)^n}
$$

### Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

IRR is \( r \) such that:
$$
PV = 0
$$

If \( d \) is the discount factor:  
$$
r = \frac{1}{d} - 1
$$

### Tax
Tax adjusted rate is ( r_after ) such that:
$$
r_{after} = (1 - r_t)r
$$

### Real Interest Rate
Real interest rate is ( r_0 ) such that:
$$
1 + r_0 = \frac{1+r}{1+f}
$$
$$
r_0 = \frac{r-f}{1+f}
$$

### Annuity
Perpetual annuity:
$$
PV = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{A}{(1+r)^k} = \frac{A}{1+r} + \sum_{k=2}^{\infty} \frac{A}{(1+r)^k} = \frac{A}{1+r} + \frac{PV}{1+r}
$$
$$
PV = \frac{A}{r}
$$

Standard Annuity:
$$
PV = \frac{A}{r}(1 - \frac{1}{(1+r)^n}) = \frac{A((1+r)^n - 1)}{r(1+r)^n}
$$

### Accumulated Interest
Bond accumulated interest:
$$
AI = \frac{\text{\# of days since last coupon}}{\text{\# of days in current coupon period}} \times C_k
$$

### Yield To Maturity
Present Value:
$$
PV = \frac{F}{(1+\frac{y}{m})^n} + \sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{\frac{C}{m}}{(1+\frac{y}{m})^k}
$$
$$
PV = \frac{F}{(1 + \frac{y}{m})^n} + \frac{C}{y} \times (1 - \frac{1}{(1+\frac{y}{m})^n})
$$

### Current Yield
Current Yield:
$$
cy = \frac{c}{p} \times 100
$$

### Duration
General Equation:
$$
D = \frac{\sum_{k=0}^{n}PV_k \times k}{PV}
$$

Interest Derivation:
$$
PV = \sum_{k=0}^{n}e^{-r(k)} \times x_k
$$
$$
\frac{dPV}{dr} = \sum_{k=0}^{n}e^{-r\times{k}} \times {-k}(x_k) = -D \times PV
$$

$$
\frac{dPV}{dr} \times \frac{1}{PV} = -D
$$

Macaulay Duration:
$$
D = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{k}{m} \times \frac{C_k}{(1+\frac{y}{m})^k}}{\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{C_k}{(1+\frac{y}{m})^k}}
$$

Macaulay Constant Coupon Payments Duration:
$$
D = \frac{1+\frac{y}{m}}{y} - \frac{1+\frac{y}{m}+n(\frac{C}{m}-\frac{y}{m})}{C\times((1+\frac{y}{m})^{n}-1)+y}
$$

### Modified Duration
Useful Derivation:
$$
PV_k = \frac{C_k}{\left(1+\frac{y}{m}\right)^k}
$$
$$
\frac{dPV_k}{dy} = \frac{\frac{-k}{m}\times C_k}{\left( 1+\frac{y}{m} \right)^{k+1}} = \frac{\frac{-k}{m}}{1+\frac{y}{m}}\times PV_k
$$
$$
p = \sum_{k=1}^{n}PV_k
$$
$$
\frac{dp}{dy} = \sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{dPV_k}{dy} = \frac{-1}{1+\frac{y}{m}}\times \sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{k\times PV_k}{m} = \frac{-D\left(p \right)}{1+\frac{y}{m}}
$$
$$
D_m = \frac{D}{1+\frac{y}{m}}
$$
$$
\frac{dp}{dy} = -D_m\times p
$$
$$
\Delta p \approx -D_m \times p \times \Delta y
$$

### Convexity
Useful Derivation:
$$
PV_k = \frac{C_k}{\left(1+\frac{y}{m}\right)^k}
$$
$$
\frac{dPV_k^2}{d^2y} = \frac{d}{dy}  \frac{\frac{-k}{m}}{1+\frac{y}{m}}\times PV_k = \frac{k\times\left(k+1 \right) \times C_k}{m^2 \times \left( 1+\frac{y}{m} \right)^{k+2}} = \frac{1}{\left(1+\frac{y}{m} \right)^2} \times \frac{k \times \left(k+1 \right)}{m^2} \times PV_k
$$
$$
PC = \frac{1}{\left(1+\frac{y}{m} \right)^2} \times \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{k\left(k+1 \right)}{m^2} \times \frac{C_k}{\left(1+\frac{y}{m}\right)^k}}{\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{C_k}{(1+\frac{y}{m})^k}}
$$
$$
\frac{dp^2}{d^2y} = \frac{d}{dy} \frac{-1}{1+\frac{y}{m}}\times \sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{k\times PV_k}{m} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{\left(1+\frac{y}{m} \right)^2} \times \frac{k \times \left(k+1 \right)}{m^2} \times PV_k = P \times PC
$$
$$
\Delta p \approx -D_m \times P \times \Delta y + \frac{P \times PC}{2} \times \left(\Delta y \right)^2
$$

### Portfolio Duration
Total price:
$$
p = \sum_{k=0}^{i}p_i
$$
$$
D = \sum_{k=0}^{i}\frac{p_i \times D_i}{p}
$$

e^{s_k \times k}
$$

### Spot Rate Discount Factor

$$
\frac{1}{s_k}
$$

### Determining Spot Rate
Find initial 1-year zero coupon default risk free security spot rate then use this pricing model for \(t\)th-year zero coupon default risk free securities:
$$
p = \sum_{k=1}^{t}\frac{C_k}{\left(1+s_k\right)^k}
$$

### Forward Rate
Count from spot rate count:
$$
\frac{t\left(t+1\right)}{2}
$$

Yearly \(j > i \):
$$
f_{i,j} = \sqrt[j-i]{\frac{\left(1+s_j\right)^j}{\left(1+s_j\right)^i}}-1
$$
Periods \( j > i \):
$$
f_{i,j} = m \times \sqrt[j-i]{\frac{\left(1+\frac{s_j}{m}\right)^j}{\left(1+\frac{s_i}{m}\right)^i}}-m
$$
Continuous \( j > i \):
$$
f_{i,j} = \frac{s_j\times j - s_i \times i}{j-i}
$$

### Forward Rate Discount Factor

$$

### Term Structure Duration
Fisher-Weil Duration \(Continuous\):
$$
D = \frac{\sum_{k=0}^{n}x_k \times k \times e^{-k \times s_k}}{\sum_{k=0}^{n}x_k \times e^{-k \times s_k}}
$$
Quasi-Modified Duration:
$$
D_Q = \frac{\sum_{k=0}^{n}\frac{k}{m}\times x_k \times \left(1+\frac{s_k}{m}\right)^{-\left(k+1\right)}}{\sum_{k=0}^{n}x_k\times \left(1+\frac{s_k}{m}\right)^{-k}}
$$

$$
$$
\frac{dp\left(\lambda\right)}{d\lambda} = -\sum_{k=0}^{n}x_k\times k \times e^{-k\left(s_k+\lambda\right)}
$$
$$
\frac{dp\left(0\right)}{d\lambda} = -D \times p\left(0\right)

\frac{dp\left(0\right)}{d\lambda} = -\sum_{k=0}^{n}x_k\times \frac{k}{m} \times \left(1+\frac{s_k}{m}\right)^{-\left(k+1\right)} = -D_Q \times P(0)
$$

### Personal Observations

#### Price change with respect to yield
Without formal proof, a generalization of the results found from duration and convexity:
$$
\Delta p \approx -\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{k}{m}\times \frac{C_k}{\left(1+\frac{y}{m} \right)^{k+1}} \times \Delta y + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{k\left(k+1 \right)}{m^2} \times \frac{C_k}{\left(1+\frac{y}{m} \right)^{k+2}} \times \left(\Delta y \right)^2 - \frac{1}{6}\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{k\left(k+1 \right)\left(k+2 \right)}{m^3}\times\frac{C_k}{\left(1+\frac{y}{m} \right)^k+3} \times \left(\Delta y \right)^3 \dots
$$
$$
\Delta p = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\left[\frac{\left(-1 \right)^i}{i!} \times \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{\prod_{j=0}^{i-1}k+j}{m^i} \times \frac{C_k}{\left( 1+ \frac{y}{m} \right)^{k+i}} \times \left(\Delta y \right)^i\right]
$$

## Key Terms & Concepts

### Cash Flow
A sequence of money values over time, represented as:  
$$ (x_0, x_1, \dots, x_n) $$

### Cash Flow Stream
A vector of cash flows indexed by time; describes inflows/outflows over multiple periods.

### Comparison Principle
If one cash flow stream yields strictly more in every period than another, it is preferred.

### No-Arbitrage Principle
No way to make a profit without risk or investment. Equivalent cash flows must have the same price.

### Dynamic Markets
Markets where cash flows and valuations evolve over time.

### Risk Aversion
Preference for more certain outcomes over uncertain ones with the same expected return.

### Hedging
Using strategies or instruments to reduce exposure to financial risk.

### Risk Assessment
Evaluating potential losses and their likelihood.

### Futures
Contracts to buy/sell an asset at a set price at a set time.

### Present Value (PV)
The current value of future payments discounted at a given rate.

### Future Value (FV)
The value of cash flows at a future date using compound interest.

### Discounting
Determining the present value of future cash flows.

### Discount Factor
The factor used to convert future value to present:  
$$ \frac{1}{(1 + r)^t} $$

### Equivalent Streams
Two cash flow streams with the same present value:  
$$ \text{PV}(A) = \text{PV}(B) $$

### Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
The interest rate that sets the net present value of a cash flow stream to zero.

### Net Present Value (NPV)
Difference between present value of benefits and costs:  
$$ \text{NPV} = \text{PV}_{\text{Benefits}} - \text{PV}_{\text{Costs}} $$

### Present Value Method
Choose the project with the highest NPV.

### Internal Rate of Return Method
Choose the project with the highest IRR, assuming IRR is unique and exceeds the cost of capital.

### Risk-Free Rates
Return from virtually default-free investments (e.g., 3-month T-bills, bank certificates, cost of capital).

### Cost of Capital
Rate of return that a company must offer to potential investors.

### Nominal Interest Rate
Stated annual interest rate, without compounding.

### Effective Interest Rate
True annual return after compounding:  
$$ \left(1 + \frac{r}{m}\right)^m - 1 $$
### Inflation Rate
The percentage increase in the general price level of goods and services over a period of time. Commonly measured by indices like the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

### Real Dollars (Constant Dollars)
Dollar values that have been adjusted for inflation, reflecting purchasing power in terms of a base year. Used for accurate comparisons across different time periods.

### Actual Dollars (Nominal Dollars)
Dollar values not adjusted for inflation; reflect the value at the time of the transaction. Used in everyday pricing and accounting. May distort comparisons across time unless inflation is considered.

### Real Interest Rate
The interest rate that has been adjusted for inflation. Reflects the true increase in purchasing power for the lender or investor.

### General Obligation Municipal Bond

A municipal bond backed by the full faith, credit, and taxing power of the issuer.

### Revenue Municipal Bond

A municipal bond backed by revenues from a specific project or source (e.g., toll roads).

### Corporate Bond

A bond issued by a corporation to raise capital, typically with higher risk and return than government bonds.

### Indenture

A legal contract between the bond issuer and bondholders detailing the terms of the bond.

### Callable Indenture

An indenture provision allowing the issuer to redeem the bond before maturity.

### Sinking Funds Indenture

A provision requiring the issuer to periodically set aside funds to repay the bond.

### Debt Subordination

### Bond Rating

An evaluation of the credit quality and default risk of a bond, provided by rating agencies.

| Grade          | Moody | S&P |
| -------------- | ----- | --- |
| High           | Aaa   | AAA |
|                | Aa    | AA  |
| Medium         | A     | A   |
|                | Baa   | BBB |
| Speculative    | Ba    | BB  |
|                | B     | B   |
| Default Danger | Caa   | CCC |
|                | Ca    | CC  |

|                |       | D   |

### Investment Grade Bond

A bond with a relatively low risk of default, rated BBB or higher by S&P or Baa or higher by Moody's.

### Junk Bond

A high-yield, high-risk bond rated below investment grade.

### Yield To Maturity

The internal rate of return for a bond.

### Par Bond

A bond that is trading at its face value (i.e., market price = par value -> coupon rate = yield to maturity).

### Yield To Call
The return a bondholder receives if the bond is called (redeemed by the issuer) before its maturity date. Calculated similarly to Yield to Maturity (YTM), but uses the call date and call price instead of maturity date and face value.

### Bond Duration
A measure of a bond’s sensitivity to interest rate changes. Expressed in years, it represents the weighted average time to receive the bond’s cash flows. Higher duration indicates more price sensitivity to interest rate changes.

### Interest Duration

Reflects how long, in years, it takes to recover the bond's price through interest payments.

### Macaulay Duration

Weighted average time to cash flow receipt using yield to maturity

### Price-Yield Curve

A graphical representation showing the inverse relationship between a bond’s price and its yield. Price drops more slowly as yields rise and rises faster as yields fall. Useful for visualizing how bond prices react to market interest rate movements. Longer maturities lead to more drastic price change effects from yield changes pivoting along bond par.

## Equations

### Present and Future Value

Simple Interest:  
$$ V = P(1 + rt) $$

Compound Interest:  
$$ V = P(1 + r)^t $$

Compounded \( m \) times per year:  
$$
V = P\left(1 + \frac{r}{m}\right)^{mt}
$$

Continuous Compounding:  
$$
\lim_{m \to \infty} \left(1 + \frac{r}{m} \right)^m = e^r
$$
$$
\left(1 + \frac{r}{m} \right)^{mt} \to e^{rt}
$$

### Future Value of a Cash Flow Stream
$$
\text{FV} = \sum_{k=0}^{n}x_k\left(1+r\right)^{n-k}
$$

### Present Value of a Cash Flow Stream

Discrete:  
$$
\text{PV} = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{x_k}{(1 + \frac{r}{m})^k}
$$

Continuous:  
$$
\text{PV} = \sum_{k=0}^{n} x_k \times e^{{-r}\times{k}}
$$

From FV:  
$$
\text{PV} = \frac{\text{FV}}{(1 + r)^n}
$$

### Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

IRR is \( r \) such that:  
$$
\text{PV} = 0
$$

If \( c \) is the discount factor:  
$$
r = \frac{1}{c} - 1
$$

### Tax
Tax adjusted rate is ( r_after ) such that:
$$
r_{after} = (1 - r_t) r
$$

### Real Interest Rate
Real interest rate is ( r_0 ) such that:
$$
1 + r_0 = \frac{1+r}{1+f}
$$
$$
r_0 = \frac{r-f}{1+f}
$$

### Annuity
Perpetual annuity:
$$
PV = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{A}{(1+r)^k} = \frac{A}{1+r} + \sum_{k=2}^{\infty} \frac{A}{(1+r)^k} = \frac{A}{1+r} + \frac{PV}{1+r}
$$
$$
PV = \frac{A}{r}
$$

Standard Annuity:
$$
PV = \frac{A}{r}(1 - \frac{1}{(1+r)^n}) = \frac{A((1+r)^n - 1)}{r(1+r)^n}
$$

### Accumulated Interest
Bond accumulated interest:
$$
AI = \frac{\text{\# of days since last coupon}}{\text{\# of days in current coupon period}} \times C_k
$$

### Yield To Maturity
Present Value:
$$
PV = \frac{F}{(1+\frac{y}{m})^n} + \sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{\frac{C}{m}}{(1+\frac{\text{y}}{m})^k}
$$
$$
PV = \frac{F}{(1 + \frac{y}{m})^n} + \frac{C}{y} \times (1 - \frac{1}{(1+\frac{y}{m})^n})
$$

### Current Yield
Current Yield:
$$
cy = \frac{c}{p} \times 100
$$

### Duration
General Equation:
$$
D = \frac{\sum_{k=0}^{n}PV_k \times k}{PV}
$$

Interest Derivation:
$$
PV = \sum_{k=0}^{n}e^{-r(k)} \times x_k
$$
$$
\frac{\text{d PV}}{dr} = \sum_{k=0}^{n}e^{-r\times{k}} \times {-k}(x_k) = -D \times PV
$$

$$
\frac{\text{dPV}}{\text{dr}} \times \frac{1}{PV} = -D
$$

Macaulay Duration:
$$
D = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{k}{m} \times \frac{C_k}{(1+\frac{y}{m})^k}}{\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{C_k}{(1+\frac{y}{m})^k}}
$$

Macaulay Constant Coupon Payments Duration:
$$
D = \frac{1+\frac{y}{m}}{y} - \frac{1+\frac{y}{m}+n(\frac{C}{m}-\frac{y}{m})}{C\times((1+\frac{y}{m})^{n}-1)+y}
$$

## Theorems

### IRR Uniqueness Theorem
If a cash flow stream begins with a single negative outflow followed by all positive inflows, then:

> There exists **exactly one unique** IRR.
